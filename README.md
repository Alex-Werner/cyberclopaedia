# Master Hacking Notes
This is a collection of notes about cybersecurity which I will be expanding throughout the years.

A particular piece of software called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is required for viewing the notes correctly. Most of the notes can still be viewed on GitHub, but the images won't load properly, unless you are using Obsidian. In the future, the notes might be made fully accessible through the internet, but for now you need to clone the repo.
