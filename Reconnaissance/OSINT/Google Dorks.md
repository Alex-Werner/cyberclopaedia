# Introduction
Goolge can be a very powerful tool in your OSINT toolkit. *Google dorking* or *Google hacking* is the art of using specially crafted Google queries to expose sensitive information on the Internet. Such a query is called a *Google dork*.

You may find all sorts of data and information, including exposed *passwd* files, lists with usernames, software versions, and so on.

*Note: If you find such an exposed web server, do NOT click on the links from the search results. Such an act may be considered illegal! Only do this if you have written permission from the target system's owner.*

A good resource for finding Google dorks is the Google Hacking Database located at https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database.
