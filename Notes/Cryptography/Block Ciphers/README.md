# Introduction
A block cipher is an encryption scheme which works on plaintexts of a fixed size. Furthermore, it is usually paired with a *mode of operation*. The size is typically small, such as 64 or 128 bits, although, it is possible to have smaller or larger block sizes. Large block sizes have a lofty memory footprint and are less efficient. It is, however, paramount that the block size is also not too small lest the cipher becomes vulnerable to a codebook attack. This attack is actuated by the construction of a look-up table which contains all possible plaintext-ciphertext pairs generated by a given block cipher and can be easily used to look up a plaintext given its ciphertext. For example, a block size of 16 requires only $2^{16} \times 2^{16} = 2^{20}$ bits of memory, which is equal to 128 kilobytes. With the 32-bit blocks, the memory needs grow to 16 gigabytes which is still feasible. However, with a block size of 64 bits, the memory required shoots up to $2^{70}$ bits. Good luck storing that.

# Anatomy of a Block Cipher
Block ciphers represent a repetition of *rounds*, which are short and simple sequences of operation. The strength of a block cipher lies not in its complexity, but rather its repetitiveness. The ciphertext of a given block is the sequence of rounds applied to the plaintext: $c = R_3(R_2(R_1(p, {k^{\prime}}), {k^{\prime\prime}}),{k^{\prime\prime\prime}})$. In addition to the output of the previous round, each round also takes in a *round key*. The round keys $k^{\prime},k^{\prime\prime},k^{\prime\prime\prime},...$ are generated from the master key $k$ through an algorithm bearing the name *key schedule*. The round functions $R_1, R_2,...$ are usually the same algorithm which why it is crucial that they are provided with different round keys in order to generate different outputs.

## Slide Attacks and Round Keys
Repeating round keys open room for *slide attacks*. These look for plaintext-ciphertext pairs $(p_1, c_1)$ and $(p_2, c_2)$ where $p_2 = R(p_1)$. Since both the round algorithm and key are identical, then if $p_2 = R(p_1)$ implies that $c_2 = R(c_1)$. This relationship will hold true no matter how many repetitions of the round the plaintext goes through.
