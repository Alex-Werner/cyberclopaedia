# Introduction
Hyperlinking is a novel shell code execution technique which allows shell code to invoke procedures from external libraries by abusing the dynamic linker. Typically shell code must rely on syscalls to serve its duty, but this is now no longer the case. The technique has currently only been developed and tested for ELF executables with a PE extension on its way.
