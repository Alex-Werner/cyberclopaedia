# Introduction
The Set Owner User ID (SUID) and Set Group ID (SGID) are special permissions which can be attributed to Linux files and folders. If a file has either of those set, then it will be executed with the privileges of the owner / group, respectively, no matter which user actually invoked the command to run the file. 

Therefore, any files which are owned by root and have SUID set will be executed with elevated privileges. Our goal is to hunt down those files and abuse them in order to escalate our privileges. This can be easily done with the following command:

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f -user root 2>/dev/null
```

You should diligently inspect the list of files returned. Some standard Linux binaries may allow for privilege escalation if they have the SUID bit set for one reason or another. It is useful to go through these binaries check them on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/).

 In the above example, we find that `/bin/systemctl` has the SUID bit set and that it also has an [entry in GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/#suid):

By following the instructions, although with slight modifications, we can run commands with escalated privileges:
