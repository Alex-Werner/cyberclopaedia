# 1. Goals of Malware Analysis
Malware analysis serves the purpose of providing the information needed to respond to a network intrusion. You will typically need to determine what took place and make sure that you have identified all of the infected machines and files. In analyzing suspected malware, you will seek to determine exactly what it does, how it can be detected on a network, and how to measure and contain its damage.
- *host-based signatures* - also known as indicators, are used to detect malicious code on victim computers. These often identify files created and/or modified by the malware or specific changes it makes to the registry. Unlike antivirus signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system and not on what its characteristics are. Hence why they are better at detected malware which mutates or has been erased from the hard disk.
- *network singnatures* - they detect malware by analyzing network traffic.

# 2. Malware Analysis Techniques
- Basic Static Analysis - examining the executable without looking at the actual instructions. It can provide confirmation of whether a file is malicious, information about its functionality, and information for producing network signatures. It is straightforward and often quick, but rather ineffective against sophisticated malware.
- Basic Dynamic Analysis - running the malware and examining its behaviour in order to remove it from the system, produce effective signatures, or both. It requires an environment to run the malware without affecting your host system or network.
- Advanced Static Analysis - reverse-engineering the malware by loading the executable into a disassembler and examining the program instructions in order to piece together what the program does.
- Advanced Dyanamic Analysis - using a debugger to look at the internal state of the malicious code at runtime.
