# Overview
SQL Injections allow an attacker to alter queries that an application sends to its database. This may enable the attacker to view data which they usually shouldn't have access to, edit this data arbitrarily, or modify the actual database in ways that they shouldn't be able to. In general, SQL injections could allow for the following:
- Reading sensitive data from a database
- Modifying the database data with `insert`, `update`, or `delete` queries
- Execution of privileged commands such as shutting the entire database down
- Reading files from the file system that the database is stored on
- Writing files into the file system
- Execution of additional OS commands

# Types of SQLi
1. In-band - the attacker launches the attack and obtains the results through the same communication channel
	- Error-based injections - retrieve information about the database, its structure and data, from error messages
	- Union-based injections - combine results from a legitimate query with those from the attack in order to obtain data

2. Out-of-band - the results from the attack are exfiltrated using a different channel than the one the query was issued through
	-  Examples include creating an HTTP connection for sending results to a different web server or DNS tunneling
	-  It requires specific extenstions to be enable in the database management software
	-  The targated database server must be able to send outbound network requests without any restrictions

3. Blind (Inferential) - they rely on changes in the behaviour with the database or application in order to extract information, since the actual data isn't sent back to the attacker
	- usually detected through time delays or boolean conditions
