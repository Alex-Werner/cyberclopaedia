# Introduction
You can test for SQL injections by injecting a single quote (`'`) into any input fields or parameters which are sent to the server. Sometimes the server errors out and if proper error handling isn't implemented in the target application, the error my provide you with useful infomation such as the database engine, its version or even parts of the query into which you tried to inject.
