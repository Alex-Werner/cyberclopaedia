# What are you looking for?
The goal of OSINT (OpenSource Intelligence Gathering) is to obtain information about the victim. This is *passive* reconnaissance as it doesn't interact with the target systems at all and is therefore not detectable. You should be generally looking for the following:
- usernames, profile names and email addresses
- passwords, PINs, private keys
- domain names
- hostnames
- software and OS types, versions, and names
- IP addresses
- technical documentation

# Where can you find this information?
- social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc.)
- personal websites
- accounts in forums and common platforms such as Github
- public databases (wireless registrars, ICANN, domain name registrars, libraries, and even phone directories)
- peer-to-peer sharing networks
