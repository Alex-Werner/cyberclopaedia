# Instructions
Each program is comprised of a set of instructions which tell the CPU what operations it needs to perform. Different CPU architectures make use of different instruction sets, however, all of them boil down to two things - an opertation code (opcode) and optional data that the instruction operates with. These are all represented using bits - 1s and 0s.
