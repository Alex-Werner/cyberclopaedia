# Introduction
Source code gets compiled to assembly and then assembly gets compiled to machine code. Assembly has a direct one-to-one mapping of its instructions to those in machine language. This makes assembly the only possible way to disambiguously take a look at what a program does. Assembly is essentially a human readable version of machine code.
