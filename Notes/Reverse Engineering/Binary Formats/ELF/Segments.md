# Introduction
Segments split the ELF binary into parts which are then loaded into memory by the OS programme loader. They can be thought of as grouping sections by their attributes and only selecting those which will be loaded into memory. In essence, segments contain information needed at runtime, while sections contain information needed at link-time. 

# The Programme Header Table
Segments are described by *programme headers* which are stored in the Programme Header Table (PHT). These structs are again defined in `<elf.h>`:

```cpp
typedef struct
{
  Elf32_Word	p_type;			/* Segment type */
  Elf32_Off	    p_offset;		/* Segment file offset */
  Elf32_Addr	p_vaddr;		/* Segment virtual address */
  Elf32_Addr	p_paddr;		/* Segment physical address */
  Elf32_Word	p_filesz;		/* Segment size in file */
  Elf32_Word	p_memsz;		/* Segment size in memory */
  Elf32_Word	p_flags;		/* Segment flags */
  Elf32_Word	p_align;		/* Segment alignment */
} Elf32_Phdr;

typedef struct
{
  Elf64_Word	p_type;			/* Segment type */
  Elf64_Word	p_flags;		/* Segment flags */
  Elf64_Off	    p_offset;		/* Segment file offset */
  Elf64_Addr	p_vaddr;		/* Segment virtual address */
  Elf64_Addr	p_paddr;		/* Segment physical address */
  Elf64_Xword	p_filesz;		/* Segment size in file */
  Elf64_Xword	p_memsz;		/* Segment size in memory */
  Elf64_Xword	p_align;		/* Segment alignment */
} Elf64_Phdr;
```
